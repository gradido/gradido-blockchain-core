 *  @ingroup utils
 *  @brief A pointer and its size, kept together.
 *
 *  @ref grd_memory keeps no per allocation bookkeeping, so grd_free() and grd_realloc()
 *  ask the caller for the size the buffer was allocated with — fine where that size is
 *  obvious, a hazard where it is not. A block carries it along and updates both halves in
 *  one step, so they cannot drift apart. Every function here is a thin inline wrapper and
 *  passes the allocator straight through; NULL still means malloc/free.
 *
 *  @c size records what the block was *allocated* with, because that is the number the
 *  grd_* calls have to be told later. It is not the caller's logical length.
 *
 *  In arena mode a resize or free of anything but the tail returns
 *  @ref GRD_WARNING_ARENA_MEMORY_NOT_RECLAIMED. What that leaves in the descriptor differs
 *  per function, so check the warning explicitly: `GRD_SUCCESS != result` reads a completed
 *  resize as a failure, and ignoring it reads memory the arena still holds as released.
 *  Which of the two matters depends on the call site.
